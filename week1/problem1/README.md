# Problem 1

You have a grid of integers called "accounts", with m rows and n columns. Each cell accounts[i][j] represents the amount of money that the i-th customer has in the j-th bank. Your task is to calculate the wealth of the richest customer, defined as the total amount of money they have across all their bank accounts. Then, return this maximum wealth value. Note that this value does not reveal the identity of any particular customer.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
<b>Output:</b> 600
</pre>


**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> accounts = [[100], [200], [300]] 
<b>Output:</b> 300
</pre>

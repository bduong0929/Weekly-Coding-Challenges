Friday Coding Challenges for Associates

Every Friday, associates will be assigned two coding challenges - one easy and one hard - to complete. To pass, associates must correctly solve at least one of the two challenges. Associates who correctly solve both challenges will receive extra credit.

To maintain the integrity of the program, camera monitoring will be used during the challenge, and any signs of cheating will result in penalties.

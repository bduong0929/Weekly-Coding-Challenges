Weekly Coding Challenges for Associates

Join us every Friday for our weekly coding challenges! Each week, you'll be assigned two coding challenges - one easy and one hard - to complete within an hour. To pass, you must correctly solve at least one of the two challenges. Associates who correctly solve both challenges will receive extra credit.

To maintain the integrity of the program, we'll use camera monitoring during the challenge, and any signs of cheating will result in penalties.

Instructions:

- You'll have one hour to complete both challenges.
- Please push your code to your repository five minutes prior to the end time.
- This is to prevent other associates from looking at your repository since it is not private.
